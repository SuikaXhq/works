Problem Description
Sun Yat-sen’s Mausoleum is situated at the foot of the second peak of Mount Zijin (Purple Mountain) in Nanjing. 
Tourists can enjoy the beautiful skyline of Nanjing by 392 stairs leading to the vault, as shown in Figure 1. 
Now, assume you can climb 1, 2, or 3 stairs at a time. 
How many different ways can you reach exactly to the vault?

For instance,if there is only 10 stairs to the vault, 
one possible climbing way is “3–>3–>3–>1”, 
another way is “2–>2–>2–>1–>1–>1–>1”. 
You should write the following four programs (they are all required): 
• A simple recursive version, maybe it does not work for the 392 stairs but is OK for small numbers, e.g., 5 or 10. 
• An improved recursive version with O(n) time complexity and will output the final correct answer. 
• A bottom-up version with memoization at O(n) time complexity. 
• A final fast version without memoization at O(n) time complexity.
